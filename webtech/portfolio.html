            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey there, internet wanderer! I'm David, but you can call me Davey Lupes (because why not have a cool nickname?). I'm the kind of go-getter who doesn't just get things—I obliterate them with relentless curiosity. Especially when it comes to tech. 
                I've been playing cat and mouse with cybersecurity for over a year now. My job? Breaking systems, finding flaws, and then, like a true vigilante, advising on how to fix them. Think of me as the Batman of the digital world, minus the cape and the tragic backstory.
                I've spent my life on a quest to discover what truly makes me happy. Spoiler alert: it's learning. Yep, I'm that person who actually enjoys picking up new skills and knowledge. Right now, I'm diving into software development just for fun (because who needs hobbies when you can code?). But my real passion? Web3 and smart contract audits. Nothing gets my blood pumping like the decentralized web and making sure your smart contracts aren't, well, dumb.
                By day, I'm a cybersecurity consultant at WhirlyLabs, where I put my skills to good use protecting the digital realm. By night? Well, let's just say I'm probably reading about the latest tech trends or finding new ways to break things—purely for educational purposes, of course.
                So, welcome to my world. It's a wild ride, but someone's gotta do it.</p>
